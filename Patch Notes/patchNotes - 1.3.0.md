## 🇷 Cubey's Kiyopack 1.3.0
For complete changelog, see [Github](https://github.com/hexagonelle/cubeys_kiyopack/blob/35b025cb1488dd99623f2a90fa18d3dbaa8559aa/Changelog/changelog%20-%201.3.0.md)

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**
- JourneyMap has been kept in to ease the transition, but players should switch to Xaero's, as future versions will not include JourneyMap.
- Areas will need to be reclaimed with the new claims system.
- Cobblemon may still be bugged. To prevent crashes, please use SHIFT when looking at a pokemon you want to catch. The pokemon's ability will be shown at the top of the screen. If this ability is "dummy", KILL THAT POKEMON.
