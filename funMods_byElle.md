The following is a set of threads containing my Minecraft mod recommendations. They are organized loosely by "mod type". I also rated them as follows:
**required?** How important is it to have the mod
- 🔴 Not necessary
- 🟡 Recommended
- 🟢 Necessary
 **cool factor?** How much I personally like having the mod
- 1 to 5 stars (⭐)
 **elle's playtime?** How much experience I have using the mod
- 🕑 No experience
- 🕑🕑 Played a little bit, or a long time ago
- 🕑🕑🕑 Moderate experience
- 🕑🕑🕑🕑 Played a lot
- 🕑🕑🕑🕑🕑 Expert on this mod

Mods with 🟢 are mostly reserved for optimizations to Minecraft. Optimization mods don't affect gameplay but just make the game run more smoothly.

Mods with 🟡 are mostly reserved for quality of life improvements. Including 🟡 and 🟢 mods would more or less make a Vanilla+ server.

All the most fun and interesting mods are marked 🔴. Each one would be great to have, but any can be removed if the modpack is too heavy.

**In total, there are 209 suggested mods.**
